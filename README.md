### Source Code
The complete project source code is in the `src/` folder:
- `src/backend/`: FastAPI server, ML inference, QoS engine
- `src/frontend/`: React + Vite dashboard, real-time UI, multi-UE monitoring

### Models Used
None (we used only self-developed models)

### Models Published
- **CATO Multi-Class Traffic Classifier**

### Datasets Used
- `Samsung_dataset.csv` â€“ Public dataset provided for training (used internally)
- `website_testing.csv` â€“ Real-world encrypted traffic flows for testing

### Attribution
This project was built entirely from scratch during the hackathon. No existing open-source project was used as a base. All components â€” including the machine learning model, QoS engine, backend API, and frontend dashboard â€” were developed in-house by Team GadaSoftware.

The solution strictly uses:
- Open-source libraries (MIT/Apache 2.0 licensed): scikit-learn, FastAPI, React, Vite
- Public datasets: `Samsung_dataset.csv`, `website_testing.csv`
- Self-developed code and models

No third-party APIs, cloud services, or proprietary tools were used.
